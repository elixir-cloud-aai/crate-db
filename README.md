## Description

Various research artifacts are produced daily around the world, but managing
them is a tedious task for a researcher as any researcher will want to spend
more time researching new stuff rather than finding a way to efficiently store,
retrieve, or share them. The management of these research artifacts becomes a
problem, that's where exactly Crate DB comes into play.

Crate DB mainly focuses on developing a versatile backend to
manage and share RO_Crates using various technologies. The end goal is to
make it easy for a user to manage any RO_Crate.
